						<h2>Xenqtt Features</h2>
						<p>
						Xenqtt comes with several features that make life interacting with an MQTT-enabled system much easier:
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li class="first">A fully-featured MQTT client</li>
							<li>A gateway application for HTTP interfaces into an MQTT system</li>
							<li>A proxy application that allows a cluster of 1..n clients to act as a single MQTT client, transparently</li>
							<li class="last">A mock MQTT broker that provides broker functionality. It is configurable and as such is useful in testing and debugging</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
						The following sections provide greater detail on each of these features.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="post">
						<h3>MQTT Client</h3>
						<h4>Overview</h4>
						<p>
						The Xenqtt library comes with a fully-featured MQTT client. This client allows applications to connect to and interact with an MQTT
						broker. The client supports two distinct modes of operation:
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
						<li class="first">Blocking (synchronous)</li>
						<li class="last">Non-blocking (asynchronous)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
						In synchronous mode all MQTT interactions, save for the receipt of messages from subscribed topics of course, block until they complete.
						This blocking time includes time waiting for various ACKs to messages. For example, the <code>connect</code> method will not return
						until the CONNECT has been sent and the CONNACK has been received.
						</p>
						<p>
						The asynchronous client employs a non-blocking strategy for all messages sent to the broker. A system of callbacks are employed to keep
						the client informed of various events that arise during the dispatch of messages. The callbacks available to the client are:
						</p>
						<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" class="table">
							<tr>
								<td class="tableHeader">Callback</td>
								<td class="tableHeader-last">Description</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td class="tableData"><code>connected</code></td>
								<td class="tableData-last">Invoked after the CONNACK is received from the broker</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td class="tableData"><code>disconnected</code></td>
								<td class="tableData-last">Invoked after the client disconnects from the broker</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td class="tableData"><code>published</code></td>
								<td class="tableData-last">Invoked after the PUBACK is received from the broker</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td class="tableData"><code>subscribed</code></td>
								<td class="tableData-last">Invoked after the SUBACK is received from the broker</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td class="tableData"><code>unsubscribed</code></td>
								<td class="tableData-last">Invoked after the UNSUBACK is received from the broker</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
						<h4>Notes and Caveats</h4>
						<p>
						At the current time only QoS 0 (at most once) and QoS 1 (at least once) are fully supported in the client. It is the intention of the
						Xenqtt team to add QoS 2 (exactly once) support at a later time.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="post">
						<h3>Gateway</h3>
						<p>
						The Gateway is an application that allows for HTTP-based communication with an MQTT system. Clients can connect, publish, subscribe,
						receive messages published to topics subscribed to, and disconnect all over HTTP. The Gateway facilitates the conversion from HTTP to
						MQTT for messages from the client application and MQTT to HTTP for messages back.
						</p>
						<p>
						The Gateway is currently under construction. Once its APIs and requirements are better known they will be updated here. In addition, any
						relevant and useful code samples and examples for the Gateway will be published to this website as they become available.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="post">
						<h3>Proxy</h3>
						<p>
						The Proxy allows <code>1..n</code> MQTT-enabled applications to interact with an MQTT broker as a single client. The proxy groups
						together clients that share the same client ID and manages connection, keepalive, publishing, subscribing, unsubscribing, and
						disconnecting all on behalf of the clustered application. From the client perspective they are all talking with the broker. From the
						broker's perspective it is interfacing with just a single client. The Proxy makes all of this work transparently to both ends.
						</p>
						<p>
						The Proxy is very useful for applications that are deployed in a clustered fashion. Such deployments are often used to meet scaling
						and/or performance goals. Because of the nature of MQTT if each clustered application registered with the broker individually they would
						either kick each other off until the last one registering wins or they would all connect. Either scenario is bad: one client connected
						may not be able to handle scaling and performance needs while every client getting the message might disrupt the application itself. The
						Proxy solves this problem by managing traffic from both the clients and the broker. It ensures that only one subscribe happens on behalf
						of the clients. It ensures messages published to topics subscribed to are routed to just one client. In this way it behaves much as a
						load balancer would - it distributes traffic to clients that can handle them. It knows which clients are active and can handle resends
						and similar housekeeping activies.
						</p>
						<p>
						The Proxy is currently under construction. Once its APIs and requirements are better known they will be updated here. In addition, any
						relevant and useful code samples and examples for the Proxy will be published to this website as they become available.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="post post-last">
						<h3>Mock Broker</h3>
						<p>
						The mock broker provides an MQTT broker that clients can connect to and interact with. The mock broker provides functionality that makes
						it especially useful in the following scenarios:
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
						<li class="first">Testing clients and other MQTT interactions</li>
						<li class="last">Debugging existing clients and applications</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
						The mock broker is a fully functional MQTT broker. It supports up to QoS 1; however, it does not provide any persistence and as such
						should not be used as a production-level MQTT broker. It's strength is in helping applications with testing and troubleshooting of MQTT
						applications, clients, and integrations.
